# Hi, I'm Ron 👋

### Full-Stack Engineer & Problem Solver
I design, build, and operate full-stack systems that replace spreadsheets, manual workflows, and brittle internal tools.  

I don’t build demos. I build systems that are mission-critical to daily operations.


## Featured Work

Contract-first, multi-tenant ERP built from scratch
